    "- **Shadow Prices** : These are part of the `Solution` object returned by the `Model.optimize()` function in cobrapy. They are represented as a pandas series indexed by the metabolite identifier¹[1].\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Shadow prices provide insight into how much the objective value (such as biomass production) would change if the availability of a particular metabolite were to be increased or decreased slightly.\n",

Conversely, a negative shadow price suggests that increasing the supply of the metabolite would decrease the objective value.\n",
